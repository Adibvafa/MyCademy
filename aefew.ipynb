Apple pie is a classic dessert that is loved by many, and with the right ingredients and techniques, you can make a delicious pie that will impress your friends and family. In this course, I will guide you through the process of making an apple pie from scratch, including making the crust, preparing the filling, and baking the pie to perfection. So let's get started!\"\"\", \"\"\"2: Making the Crust: The crust is an essential part of any pie, and making a good crust is key to a successful apple pie. To make the crust, you will need flour, salt, sugar, butter, and ice water. Start by mixing the flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add it to the bowl. Using a pastry cutter or your hands, work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs. Add the ice water a little at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a disk. Wrap the disks in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.\"\"\"]\n",
